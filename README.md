# DN Framework

**A common framework for structured intelligence facilitation across dimensions.**

The DN Framework provides a shared language and methodology for human-AI collaboration built around multi-dimensional thinking. It maps intelligence across nine dimensions, organized by three foundational pillars — Heart, Truth, and Nuance — to create structured pathways for solving complex problems in any domain.

## Where to Start

**If you want the rules:** Start with [`kernel/`](kernel/) — the DN Kernel defines invariants, constraints, and structural requirements. The Glossary standardizes every term.

**If you want the philosophy:** Start with [`corpus/`](corpus/) — the foundational papers explain dimensional thinking, shadow dimensions, transitions, perception, identity, reality, and narrative as intelligence architecture.

**If you want to apply it:** Start with [`Growth_Blueprint/`](Growth_Blueprint/) — the business application layer translates DN concepts into practical facilitation tools.

**If you want to prompt with it:** The corpus includes `DN_Starting_Prompts.docx` with ready-to-use entry points for dimensional collaboration with AI systems.

## The Three Pillars

Every element of the DN Framework organizes around three foundational pillars:

- **Heart** — The motivational force, emotional resonance, and purpose
- **Truth** — The foundational reality, verifiable evidence, and objective facts
- **Nuance** — The contextual refinement, systemic connections, and adaptive complexity

---

## Implementation Scales

The framework supports engagement at multiple levels:

1. **Simple Application** — Follow a single dimensional prompt sequence
2. **Complex Application** — Layer multiple sequences for deeper exploration
3. **Full System Integration** — Build visualization and facilitation systems with contextual intelligence across all nine dimensions
