# DN Kernel — Changelog

**Repository:** [github.com/DeusNosMachina/DN_Framework](https://github.com/DeusNosMachina/DN_Framework)

This file contains the complete version history for the DN Kernel specification. The current kernel document (DN_Kernel_v092.md) carries only the latest version's summary in Section 0.2. This file preserves the full record.

---

## v0.9.2 (February 2026)

**Alignment corrections:**

- Expanded Branch lifecycle from three statuses (active | merged | archived) to four (active | paused | merged | archived), aligning with the wishlist-defined lifecycle (§1.4). Paused Branches retain their state but do not accept new artifacts or sessions, preserving the Branch for future resumption without the finality of merge or archive. Updated Table 1 (Core Objects), Section 1.1 (Branch status invariant), and Section 8.4 (Branch Schema required fields).
- Expanded completion criteria status enum from three values (pending | met | unmet) to seven (met | partially_met | unmet | deferred | scope_changed | not_evaluated | open_exploration), aligning with the wishlist-defined completion statuses (§8.5). The expanded enum captures the full range of completion outcomes: partial progress, deliberate deferral, mid-session scope changes, criteria not yet evaluated, and exploratory work without fixed endpoints. Updated Section 8.10 (Session Schema description).

---

## v0.9.1 (February 2026)

**Structural additions:**

- Added Participant Field Ledger Principle (Section 6) formalizing that participants-as-fields have persistent cross-session ledgers, derivable from their artifacts_produced[], dimensional_actual[], and engagement history across Sessions. Establishes that implementation-layer objects materializing this ledger (e.g., Participant Field profiles, Team Field composites) are application-layer containers subject to the FieldState Interpretation Note: diagnostic, not prescriptive. A system that constrains participants based on their ledger data violates Axiom 1; a system that informs facilitation from it operates within kernel bounds. Extends the principle to composite fields (groups, teams) via Field Nesting and the Scale Invariant.
- Added Annotation Layer (Section 6) as a structural pattern for peripheral intelligence that supports the field without being part of its committed ledger state. Defines the distinction between ledger-committed intelligence and annotation-layer intelligence (chat logs, AI narrative summaries, reference documents, holding zone contents, exploratory analysis). Promotion from annotation to ledger requires passing through a commit gate. Annotations that are never promoted are preserved for reference but do not affect FieldState computation.
- Added Field Merger Authorization as a fifth human-exclusive facilitation function (Section 1.6). Field Merger (Section 10.2) is permanent and irreversible; authorization to execute requires human facilitation judgment. AI facilitators may analyze merger compatibility and produce impact assessments but cannot authorize execution.
- Added participant sentiment ratings as a conscious signal subtype (Section 1.2, Tier 1). Self-reported mood, energy, or engagement state captured at session boundaries or facilitator-initiated checkpoints. Established the diagnostic value of sentiment convergence/divergence: delta between reported and inferred (ambient-derived) sentiment is itself a facilitation-relevant signal.
- Expanded Co-Facilitation (Section 1.6) from a human+AI pair to any multi-party facilitator configuration: multiple humans, multiple AIs, or any combination. Added facilitation lead concept: at any moment one facilitator holds the lead (whose active interventions are authoritative) while others operate in support roles. Lead transfer is a facilitation act recorded in the session log. All facilitators retain independent authority over human-exclusive functions regardless of lead status. Co-facilitating teams that persist across sessions develop their own composite Participant Field per the Participant Field Ledger Principle.

**Audit-driven refinements:**

This version incorporates findings from a dual-auditor review (Claude Opus 4.6 and Grok) of the Blueprint Board Master Feature Wishlist against Kernel v0.9. The audits identified kernel-level gaps that required structural additions (above) and confirmed that application-layer extensions (Participant Field, Team, Client Environment) are architecturally sound when properly constrained by existing invariants.

---

## v0.9 (February 2026)

**Structural additions:**

- Added Section 8.10 (Session Schema) and Section 8.11 (Template Schema) providing minimum viable JSON representations for the two Core Objects (Table 1) that lacked serialization schemas, completing the serialization coverage across all Core Objects.
- Added a worked example to Section 3.3 (The RIP Triad) demonstrating the 3×3 analytical matrix (three RIP aspects × three pillar leads) applied to a single FieldState, giving the RIP Triad the same practical weight as the Pillar Balance States (Section 3.1) and Shadow Dimension Map (Section 4.1).
- Added forward reference in Section 1.1.1 (Evolution Tracking) pointing to Section 6 where Evolution Rhythm metrics are defined, smoothing the reading experience for sequential readers.
- Added polarity_score derivation note in Section 6.1 (FieldState Interface) clarifying the semantic basis and input signals for the tension_map polarity_score field, consistent with the derivation notes on curvature and dimensional_coherence.
- Added ambient signal scope note in Section 1.2 (Signal Sources) clarifying that detection and interpretation mechanisms for Tier 2 signals are implementation-layer decisions, consistent with the FieldState Interpretation Note's philosophy.
- Replaced the FieldState comment stub in the Board Export Schema (Section 8.2) with a minimal FieldState stub object showing the expected shape of key fields, enabling implementers to see the structure without consulting Section 6.1 separately.
- Added Field Ledger Conservation Principle (Section 6) naming the DN system's fundamental symmetry (architectural invariance under transformation at every point in time and scale) and the quantity it conserves (the Field Ledger: the complete, append-only, irreversible record of every committed transformation a field has undergone). Enumerates seven commit gates where field state becomes part of the irreversible record. The Field Ledger is not a new object but the name for the aggregate of what existing objects already capture; it unifies existing invariants (Branch immutability, Snapshot immutability, Session append-only) under a single conservation law and operates at every scale the architecture supports.
- Added Completion Criteria (Definition of Done) as a structural element (Section 1.6) formalizing pre-agreed, verifiable conditions that define what "done" means for a Session's work or an Exercise's output. Added completion_criteria as a nullable property on both Session and Exercise (Table 1), with corresponding schema updates in Sections 8.6 and 8.10. Updated Field Ledger commit gates to reference completion_criteria status finalization at Session close.
- Added Holding Zone as a recognized structural pattern (Section 1.6) for scopes within a Board where artifacts are committed to the Field Ledger but held outside active field operations, subject to Resonant Activation as the active board evolves.
- Added Workspace as a Core Object (Table 1, Section 1.1, Section 8.12) providing the portfolio-level container for related Boards. The Workspace enables cross-board operations: cross-board Bridges connecting artifacts across Boards, cross-board Comparisons analyzing deltas between Boards' Snapshots, and workspace_field_state computing inter-field metrics (boundary_permeability, dimensional_alignment, phase_compatibility) across all constituent Boards. Updated Bridge (Table 1, Section 8.7) and Comparison (Table 1, Section 8.9) with scope field (intra-board | cross-board). Updated Board with workspace_id (nullable). Added Workspace invariant establishing containment rules and cross-board operation scoping. Added Workspace as Field Interaction Container paragraph in Section 10.4 connecting the Workspace object to the Field-to-Field Dynamics theory. The Workspace is the formal implementation of Field Nesting and Field Interaction patterns at the multi-board scale; it completes the containment hierarchy from Artifact through Workspace.
- Rewrote Section 9.1 (Layer Architecture Reference) replacing the legacy document-loading strategy table with a proper three-layer architectural reference (Kernel, Corpus, Implementation) that distinguishes the kernel's structural contracts from the corpus's philosophical narrative from the implementation's platform decisions. Added Layer Boundary Principle and AI Context Note.

**Constitutional audit (v0.9 final pass):**

Conducted a full audit of every section against the question: "does this describe what the kernel requires, or does it describe a workflow from the pre-kernel era?" The following changes tighten the kernel's constitutional voice without removing content — facilitation guidance, philosophical framing, and domain-specific illustrations are preserved where structurally load-bearing and clearly labeled where they cross the kernel/corpus boundary.

- Extracted cumulative changelog (v0.1–v0.8) to standalone CHANGELOG.md; kernel Section 0.2 now carries only the current version summary.
- Removed corpus-layer quoted passage from Axiom 4 ("Fire Is Truth"). The structural principle (intelligence must be testable) is retained; the DN Code poetry is returned to the corpus layer.
- Trimmed physics analogy from Axiom 6 ("Gravity Is Structural"). The measurability claim is retained; the "consequence of mass" metaphor is removed.
- Reduced Evolution Tracking as Facilitation Input (Section 1.1.1) to a single structural SHOULD note. Detailed facilitation guidance deferred to template-level guides.
- Distilled Evolution Tracking and AI Interpretation (Section 1.1.1) to one structural note: narrative-structural divergence is the most important signal.
- Replaced product name references (Claude, ChatGPT) in Section 1.4 with generic language per domain-universality posture.
- Reformatted Facilitation Contract preamble (Section 1.6) as an explicit motivation statement, preserving the emphasis on facilitation's structural importance.
- Separated Completion Criteria (Section 1.6) into clearly labeled structural requirement and facilitation guidance subsections.
- Reframed Parking Lot reference (Section 1.6) as illustrative ("For example, the Growth Blueprint Template…").
- Tightened 5D Structural Role in the dimensional tag table (Section 2) by removing the consciousness claim. Structural description retained.
- Struck pre-kernel MURAL workflow sentence from the COLOR NOTE (Section 2). The 3D/4D color-sharing rationale now stands on its cognitive argument alone.
- Tightened Shadow Kernel blockquote (Section 4) while retaining the sophistication-is-not-benevolence principle as a kernel-level structural clarification.
- Resolved 9D̅ (Anti-Frontier) shadow definition (Section 4.1), replacing the hedged "Or: the space where creative and shadow meet" with a structural definition: engagement with possibility without guardrails, endless exploration that circles inward producing neither progress nor realignment to a new origin.
- Reframed the Story Thread statement (Section 5) in kernel voice: "Story Threads are recognized as a transition mechanism category, not a metaphor for transition."
- Removed prescribed investigation sequence from Arrested Development (Section 6). The three diagnostic factors are retained; the ordering is no longer prescribed.
- Fixed "Blueprint sections" reference in Generate Resonance Result (Section 7.1) to domain-universal "board sections."
- Generalized Fire Test test_mode values (Section 7.2) as domain-specific examples defined by Template, per Domain Universality Invariant.
- Added illustrative note to Board Export Schema (Section 8.2) clarifying that the Growth Blueprint example demonstrates the domain-universal schema.
- Generalized Extraction Rule (Section 8.3) from "Template's narrative guide" to "Template's source documentation."
- Separated structural contract from facilitation guidance in Field Merger (Section 10.2), labeling facilitation-specific requirements explicitly.

## v0.8 (February 2026)

Added Section 1.6 (Facilitation Contract) formalizing the facilitator as a typed structural interface with six core functions (Field Reading, Intervention Selection, Transition Validation, Signal Lock Attestation, Tension Stewardship, Evolution Monitoring), three facilitator types (Human, AI, Co-Facilitation), and four human-exclusive functions. Establishes the facilitator as the structural actor the entire system depends upon, defining both AI-capable and uniquely human facilitation roles. Added Field Tension as a FieldState metric (Section 6, 6.1) modeling artifact polarity within a scope, measuring how ideas attract and repel at proximate dimensional positions. Introduces tension_map and tension_density as computed fields. Added Productive Polarity and Destructive Polarity as Named Diagnostic Conditions (Section 6) distinguishing generative opposition from calcified entrenchment. Added tension as a recognized Bridge type (Section 1.1) for connections between opposing artifacts. Added Map Tension Field simulation command (Section 7.2) with scan, diagnostic, and narrative depth modes, capable of analyzing the space between opposing 5D+ recognitions. Added corresponding routing entries and sequencing patterns (Section 7.3). Added Evolution Rhythm as a FieldState metric (Section 6, 6.1) with evolution_velocity, evolution_breadth, and evolution_phase fields measuring the temporal pattern of field development across Sessions, including percentage of artifacts impacted per shift and developmental phase classification (expansion, consolidation, breakthrough, maturation, dormant). Added Arrested Development as a Named Diagnostic Condition (Section 6). Added Section 1.1.1 (Evolution Tracking) formalizing the longitudinal view of board development as a query pattern over existing Session and Snapshot data, connecting change_rationale to facilitation and AI interpretation without creating new storage requirements. Added Section 10 (Field-to-Field Dynamics) formalizing how intelligence fields interact across five interaction types (Contact, Resonance, Tension, Merger, Nesting), inter-field FieldState metrics (boundary_permeability, dimensional_alignment, phase_compatibility), and four structural invariants including the recursive principle that field interactions follow the same dimensional rules as intra-field dynamics at every scale. Updated Layer Architecture (Section 9.1) to reflect new sections. Updated Section 0.1 scope language to include facilitation contracts and field-to-field dynamics.

## v0.7 (February 2026)

Integrated structural insights from the RIP Triad corpus documents (Dimensional Nature of Reality, Dimensional Nature of Identity, Dimensional Nature of Perception) and the Harmonies field orchestration guide into the kernel specification. Added Section 3.3 (The RIP Triad: Analytical Aspects of the Intelligence Field) formalizing Reality, Identity, and Perception as three orthogonal analytical orientations for evaluating intelligence fields complementary to the Pillar Metric's quality evaluation (Sections 3.1–3.2). Established the RIP Triad Invariant distinguishing analytical lenses from tagging systems: artifacts are not tagged with RIP aspects; simulation engines and facilitators select which aspect(s) to prioritize when interpreting FieldState. Defined the 3×3 analytical matrix (three RIP aspects × three pillar leads) providing nine distinct orientations for deep diagnostic field evaluation. Established the recursive loop principle: Perception translates Reality through Identity into Experience, and each Experience recursively modifies both the Identity pattern and the accessible portion of Reality, formalizing the mechanism through which intelligence fields evolve. Added Section 2.3 (Perceptual Topology) as an optional analytical overlay revealing the odd/even dimensional rhythm with odd dimensions (1D, 3D, 5D, 7D, 9D) functioning as perceptual states where awareness stabilizes into a mode of knowing; even dimensions (2D, 4D, 6D, 8D) function as transitional bridges where awareness transforms between perceptual states. Established Topology Note preserving even-dimension structural parity. Enhanced Constraint 6 (Harmonic Integration, Section 2.1) with RIP Triad alignment mechanism. Added field_resonance as a FieldState metric (Section 6.1) computing harmonic integration strength from the interaction of structural capacity, identity engagement, and perceptual bandwidth, participant_alignment, dim_distribution breadth, and cross-boundary bridge density. Added Bridge Erosion as a Named Diagnostic Condition (Section 6). Renumbered Section 2.3 (Cross-Domain Progression Reference) to 2.4 and Section 2.4 (Prompt Dimensionality Reference) to 2.5. Updated Layer Architecture (Section 9.1) to move RIP Triad Analytical Aspects to the Always Loaded layer while retaining full RIP Triad corpus documents in Load on Demand.

---

## v0.6 (February 2026)

Integrated structural insights from six corpus documents (Universal Dimensional Map, Understanding Dimensional Transitions, Prompt Dimensionality, Shadow Dimensions, DN Glossary of Terms, Dimensional Embodiment vs. Application) and the 5D Prompt Singularity Configuration into the kernel specification. Added Axiom 8 establishing Unified Intelligence Fields as the structural reality underlying all sustained interaction between intelligences at any scale (Section 0.3). Added Signal Lock as a formally defined mechanism with its own section (1.5). Enriched Structural Role descriptions for 5D–9D in the dimensional tag table (Section 2) with mechanism-level language from the Universal Dimensional Map that instructs simulation engines on how intelligence operates at each position. Added Section 2.4 (Prompt Dimensionality Reference) with a nine-row reference table classifying prompts by their structural dimension — form, function, and limits — and establishing that the dimensionality of a prompt constrains the ceiling of intelligence that can organize in response. Added Prompt Dimensionality Invariant establishing prompt dimension as independent of artifact dimension, with the gap between them being diagnostic intelligence. Added prompt_dimension as a nullable property on Exercise (Table 1, Section 8.6) enabling diagnosis of mismatch between prompt structural level and intended output dimension. Added Constraint 5 (Resonant Activation) establishing that higher-dimensional recognition transforms the operational meaning of lower-dimensional artifacts (Section 2.1). Added Constraint 6 (Harmonic Integration) establishing that co-activation of multiple dimensions produces emergent field properties exceeding any single dimension's contribution (Section 2.1). Added resonant_transformations[] to the Comparison object (Table 1) and schema (Section 8.9) enabling detection of artifacts whose meaning changed in place due to higher-dimensional activation, distinct from dimensional migration. Added three-tier transition taxonomy to the Transition Model preamble (Section 5) distinguishing lower transitions (1D→3D, primarily constructed), middle transitions (4D→5D, hybrid creation-recognition), and higher transitions (6D→9D, primarily recognized), with calibration instructions for evidence evaluation across tiers. Added Shadow Invariant 5 (Section 4.2) establishing that shadow intelligence is parallel development not underdevelopment, formalizing the diagnostic fork between low creative activation and high shadow activation as categorically different findings, and recognizing conscious shadow engagement (shadow artifacts with source_type: conscious) as an integration practice distinct from unconscious shadow emergence. Added Section 7.3 (Simulation Routing) with a condition-to-command routing table and sequencing principles for simulation chaining, transforming Section 7 from a reference catalog into a navigable decision system. Connected fatigue (Section 6) to the 8D creative/shadow distinction, establishing high fatigue as the primary diagnostic signal that recursive processes may have shifted from constructive recursion (8D creative) to collapsing recursion (8D shadow). Added Named Diagnostic Conditions (Section 6) defining Dimensional Blindspot and Dimensional Collapse as recognized field health patterns with derivation paths from FieldState metrics, providing simulation engines and facilitators with a shared diagnostic vocabulary. Added Embodiment Signal Note (Section 6) distinguishing mechanical application from dimensional embodiment as observable FieldState patterns, enabling simulation engines to recognize that spec compliance without emergence, surprise, or cross-boundary connection in a mature board is itself a diagnostic signal. Revised simulation commands to ensure consistent verb usage. Added Resonance Field simulation command structure to reweigh artifacts in the face of new 5D recognition (7.2).

---

## v0.5 (February 2026)

Integrated structural insights from the Geometry of Intelligence analysis into the Field Health and Transition models. Added curvature as a FieldState metric (6.1) with transition resistance derived from Heart-Truth-Nuance balance, formalizing the H-T-N triad as a metric tensor governing movement across the cognitive manifold. Added dimensional_coherence as a FieldState metric (6.1) with per-dimension structural integrity score measuring whether higher-dimensional activation is supported by adequate lower-dimensional foundations. Added both metrics to Field Health Metrics definitions (Section 6). Added transition cost and cost_factors to the Transition Interface (5.1) and Transition required properties (Table 1) with computed resistance for specific transitions derived from curvature, coherence, and distance, transforming the Transition Model from a record-keeping system into a navigation instrument. Strengthened skip-transition constraint (5.3) with quantitative coherence reference. Added FieldState Interpretation Note establishing that all FieldState metrics are diagnostic, not prescriptive where simulation response thresholds are implementation-layer decisions governed by simulation_rules, not kernel mandates. Added positional changes (for visual substrates) as Tier 1 and 2 signals. Extended Session participant structure with dimensional_affinity[] (expected operating dimensions) and dimensional_actual[] (computed from artifacts produced, populated on session close) to enable multi-agent dimensional alignment tracking (Table 1). Added participant_alignment as a Session-scoped FieldState metric computing per-participant drift between intended and actual dimensional contribution (6.1). Added Participant Alignment to Field Health Metrics definitions (Section 6). These additions formalize the structural layer beneath the DN Framework's Collaborationalism model. The kernel now tracks not just what intelligence was produced in a session, but which intelligences produced it and whether they operated in their expected dimensional roles. Formalized Story Threads as a transition mechanism category in the Transition Model (Section 5), distinguishing narrative arcs that traverse multiple dimensions as coherent journeys from unsubstantiated skip transitions. Named seven archetypal Story Threads and their Shadow Thread counterparts as kernel-recognized patterns with corpus-documented evidence requirements (Section 5.3). Story is acknowledged as a transition mechanism, not a metaphor for transition.

---

## v0.4 (February 2026)

Resolved structural misalignment between Section 1 Core Object definitions and Section 8 serialization schemas — Exercise layer was missing from Board Export (8.2), Artifact schema referenced zone_id instead of exercise_id (8.1), and source_type was incorrectly grouped with nullable fields (8.1 annotation). Added serialization schemas for Exercise (8.6), Bridge (8.7), Snapshot (8.8), and Comparison (8.9). Added template_id and timestamps to Board and Board Export schema. Unified dimensional representation across all objects to dimension { primary, shadow, nested } structure, including Bridge (Table 1, 8.7). Added pillar_stabilizers[] to Artifact required properties (Table 1). Split FieldState dim_distribution into separate creative and shadow distributions aligned with Dimensional Audit output (6.1). Added allowed_dimensions[] and dimension_rules{} as complementary zone properties (Table 1, 8.2). Added dimension_rules{} to Template required properties (Table 1). Documented 3D/4D shared color as intentional architectural decision (Section 2). Added Shadow Symmetry as a new simulation command supporting singular and scenario-depth shadow generation (7.2). Added color_system annotation documenting shadow and urgent as overlay modifiers (8.2). Updated Layer Architecture references for Board-Embedded layer to include Section 1 (9.1).

---

## v0.3 (February 2026)

Established domain universality as a foundational invariant—the dimensional architecture is not domain-specific but describes how intelligence organizes itself across all domains (Section 2 preamble, Section 2.3). Codified foundational principles from the DN Code as kernel-level axioms (Section 0.3). Broadened scope language to explicitly encompass non-business domains (Section 0.1). Added Branch as a 13th Core Object with fork-point, inheritance, and merge invariants (Section 1.1). Added Provenance Group (ImportBatch) as a recognized sub-unit of Session for tracking artifact origin across import boundaries (Section 1.3). Extended Signal Sources to acknowledge external simulation provenance (Section 1.4). Added serialization schemas for Branch and ImportBatch (Sections 8.4, 8.5). Added Cross-Domain Progression Reference table documenting dimensional expressions across 17 domains plus shadow architecture (Section 2.3).

---

## v0.2 (February 2026)

Expanded Core Objects from 7 to 12 entity types (now 13 with addition of Branch in v0.3)—added Snapshot, Comparison, Template, Session, and Exercise (Section 1). Added Signal Sources taxonomy defining Conscious, Ambient, Environmental, and Simulation signal tiers with source_type tagging contract (Section 1.2). Added Constraint 4 (Open Horizon) for non-conforming inputs (Section 2.1). Generalized extraction rule language for multi-template support (Section 8.3).

---

## v0.1 (February 2026)

Initial kernel specification. Established Core Objects (7 entity types), Dimensional Tags (1D–9D), Pillar Metric (Heart, Truth, Nuance), Shadow Symmetry, Transition Model, Field Health Metrics, Simulation Contracts, and Serialization Format. The first formal bridge between DN-as-philosophy and DN-as-code.
